# JS-Application
SoftUni JS- App

In the course "JS Applications" you will learn what HTTP requests are and how to use them. You will learn about REST Services, what a Baas (backend as a service) is and how to work with it, what asynchronous code means (Promises, using async/await), what Templating and Routing are. During the course, you will create a Single Page Application, using the techniques learned from previous lectures, on which you will be assessed. You will understand what is the architecture of an application and how to properly structure your applications. By the end of the course, you'll explore different design patterns and their practical guidelines, create your own web components using the Web Components standard, and build a Webback environment from scratch.

Skills you will acquire
-What is HTTP and how to make requests
-Creating simple Single Page applications
-Working with templates and routing
-Working with non-relational databases
-Working with REST APIs and asynchronous programming
-Testing the application
